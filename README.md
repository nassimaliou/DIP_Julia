# 2CS Digital Image Processing 2021/2022

Some Image Processing methodes using python and the Julia Programming Language.


Julia is well-suited to image processing because it is a modern and elegant high-level language that is a pleasure to use, while also allowing you to write "inner loops" that compile to efficient machine code (i.e., it is as fast as C). Julia supports multithreading and, through add-on packages, GPU processing.
